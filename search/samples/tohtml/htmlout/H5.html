<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY</div>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,</li>
  <li>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign</li>
  <li>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,</li>
  <li>But that the scambling and unquiet time</li>
  <li>Did push it out of farther question.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li class="number">But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</li>
  <li>We lose the better half of our possession:</li>
  <li>For all the temporal lands which men devout</li>
  <li>By testament have given to the church</li>
  <li class="number">Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</li>
  <li>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,</li>
  <li>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</li>
  <li>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</li>
  <li>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,</li>
  <li class="number">Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.</li>
  <li>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</li>
  <li>And to the coffers of the king beside,</li>
  <li>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>This would drink deep.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li class="number">'Twould drink the cup and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>But what prevention?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>The king is full of grace and fair regard.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>And a true lover of the holy church.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>The courses of his youth promised it not.</li>
  <li class="number">The breath no sooner left his father's body,</li>
  <li>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</li>
  <li>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</li>
  <li>Consideration, like an angel, came</li>
  <li>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</li>
  <li class="number">Leaving his body as a paradise,</li>
  <li>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</li>
  <li>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</li>
  <li>Never came reformation in a flood,</li>
  <li>With such a heady currance, scouring faults</li>
  <li class="number">Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</li>
  <li>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</li>
  <li>As in this king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>We are blessed in the change.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>Hear him but reason in divinity,</li>
  <li class="number">And all-admiring with an inward wish</li>
  <li>You would desire the king were made a prelate:</li>
  <li>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</li>
  <li>You would say it hath been all in all his study:</li>
  <li>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</li>
  <li class="number">A fearful battle render'd you in music:</li>
  <li>Turn him to any cause of policy,</li>
  <li>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</li>
  <li>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,</li>
  <li>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</li>
  <li class="number">And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</li>
  <li>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</li>
  <li>So that the art and practic part of life</li>
  <li>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</li>
  <li>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</li>
  <li class="number">Since his addiction was to courses vain,</li>
  <li>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</li>
  <li>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</li>
  <li>And never noted in him any study,</li>
  <li>Any retirement, any sequestration</li>
  <li class="number">From open haunts and popularity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</li>
  <li>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</li>
  <li>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</li>
  <li>And so the prince obscured his contemplation</li>
  <li class="number">Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</li>
  <li>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</li>
  <li>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</li>
  <li>And therefore we must needs admit the means</li>
  <li class="number">How things are perfected.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>But, my good lord,</li>
  <li>How now for mitigation of this bill</li>
  <li>Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty</li>
  <li>Incline to it, or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li class="number">He seems indifferent,</li>
  <li>Or rather swaying more upon our part</li>
  <li>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</li>
  <li>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</li>
  <li>Upon our spiritual convocation</li>
  <li class="number">And in regard of causes now in hand,</li>
  <li>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</li>
  <li>As touching France, to give a greater sum</li>
  <li>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</li>
  <li>Did to his predecessors part withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li class="number">How did this offer seem received, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>With good acceptance of his majesty;</li>
  <li>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</li>
  <li>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,</li>
  <li>The severals and unhidden passages</li>
  <li class="number">Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</li>
  <li>And generally to the crown and seat of France</li>
  <li>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>What was the impediment that broke this off?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>The French ambassador upon that instant</li>
  <li class="number">Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come</li>
  <li>To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>It is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>Then go we in, to know his embassy;</li>
  <li>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</li>
  <li class="number">Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. The Presence chamber.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>Not here in presence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>Send for him, good uncle.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li class="number">Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,</li>
  <li>Before we hear him, of some things of weight</li>
  <li>That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY</div>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>God and his angels guard your sacred throne</li>
  <li class="number">And make you long become it!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>Sure, we thank you.</li>
  <li>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</li>
  <li>And justly and religiously unfold</li>
  <li>Why the law Salique that they have in France</li>
  <li class="number">Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:</li>
  <li>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</li>
  <li>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</li>
  <li>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</li>
  <li>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</li>
  <li class="number">Suits not in native colours with the truth;</li>
  <li>For God doth know how many now in health</li>
  <li>Shall drop their blood in approbation</li>
  <li>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</li>
  <li>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</li>
  <li class="number">How you awake our sleeping sword of war:</li>
  <li>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</li>
  <li>For never two such kingdoms did contend</li>
  <li>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops</li>
  <li>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</li>
  <li class="number">'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords</li>
  <li>That make such waste in brief mortality.</li>
  <li>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</li>
  <li>For we will hear, note and believe in heart</li>
  <li>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd</li>
  <li class="number">As pure as sin with baptism.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</li>
  <li>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</li>
  <li>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</li>
  <li>To make against your highness' claim to France</li>
  <li class="number">But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</li>
  <li>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</li>
  <li>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</li>
  <li>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</li>
  <li>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</li>
  <li class="number">The founder of this law and female bar.</li>
  <li>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</li>
  <li>That the land Salique is in Germany,</li>
  <li>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</li>
  <li>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</li>
  <li class="number">There left behind and settled certain French;</li>
  <li>Who, holding in disdain the German women</li>
  <li>For some dishonest manners of their life,</li>
  <li>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</li>
  <li>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</li>
  <li class="number">Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</li>
  <li>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</li>
  <li>Then doth it well appear that Salique law</li>
  <li>Was not devised for the realm of France:</li>
  <li>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</li>
  <li class="number">Until four hundred one and twenty years</li>
  <li>After defunction of King Pharamond,</li>
  <li>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</li>
  <li>Who died within the year of our redemption</li>
  <li>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</li>
  <li class="number">Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</li>
  <li>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</li>
  <li>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</li>
  <li>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</li>
  <li>Did, as heir general, being descended</li>
  <li class="number">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</li>
  <li>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</li>
  <li>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</li>
  <li>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</li>
  <li>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</li>
  <li class="number">To find his title with some shows of truth,</li>
  <li>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</li>
  <li>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</li>
  <li>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</li>
  <li>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</li>
  <li class="number">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</li>
  <li>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</li>
  <li>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</li>
  <li>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</li>
  <li>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</li>
  <li class="number">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</li>
  <li>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</li>
  <li>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</li>
  <li>Was re-united to the crown of France.</li>
  <li>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</li>
  <li class="number">King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</li>
  <li>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</li>
  <li>To hold in right and title of the female:</li>
  <li>So do the kings of France unto this day;</li>
  <li>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</li>
  <li class="number">To bar your highness claiming from the female,</li>
  <li>And rather choose to hide them in a net</li>
  <li>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</li>
  <li>Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>May I with right and conscience make this claim?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li class="number">The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!</li>
  <li>For in the book of Numbers is it writ,</li>
  <li>When the man dies, let the inheritance</li>
  <li>Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,</li>
  <li>Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;</li>
  <li class="number">Look back into your mighty ancestors:</li>
  <li>Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,</li>
  <li>From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,</li>
  <li>And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,</li>
  <li>Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,</li>
  <li class="number">Making defeat on the full power of France,</li>
  <li>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</li>
  <li>Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp</li>
  <li>Forage in blood of French nobility.</li>
  <li>O noble English. that could entertain</li>
  <li class="number">With half their forces the full Pride of France</li>
  <li>And let another half stand laughing by,</li>
  <li>All out of work and cold for action!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ELY</li>
  <li>Awake remembrance of these valiant dead</li>
  <li>And with your puissant arm renew their feats:</li>
  <li class="number">You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;</li>
  <li>The blood and courage that renowned them</li>
  <li>Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege</li>
  <li>Is in the very May-morn of his youth,</li>
  <li>Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth</li>
  <li>Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,</li>
  <li>As did the former lions of your blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>They know your grace hath cause and means and might;</li>
  <li>So hath your highness; never king of England</li>
  <li class="number">Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,</li>
  <li>Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England</li>
  <li>And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,</li>
  <li>With blood and sword and fire to win your right;</li>
  <li class="number">In aid whereof we of the spiritualty</li>
  <li>Will raise your highness such a mighty sum</li>
  <li>As never did the clergy at one time</li>
  <li>Bring in to any of your ancestors.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>We must not only arm to invade the French,</li>
  <li class="number">But lay down our proportions to defend</li>
  <li>Against the Scot, who will make road upon us</li>
  <li>With all advantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>They of those marches, gracious sovereign,</li>
  <li>Shall be a wall sufficient to defend</li>
  <li class="number">Our inland from the pilfering borderers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,</li>
  <li>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</li>
  <li>Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;</li>
  <li>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</li>
  <li class="number">Never went with his forces into France</li>
  <li>But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom</li>
  <li>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,</li>
  <li>With ample and brim fulness of his force,</li>
  <li>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</li>
  <li class="number">Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;</li>
  <li>That England, being empty of defence,</li>
  <li>Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;</li>
  <li>For hear her but exampled by herself:</li>
  <li class="number">When all her chivalry hath been in France</li>
  <li>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</li>
  <li>She hath herself not only well defended</li>
  <li>But taken and impounded as a stray</li>
  <li>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,</li>
  <li class="number">To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings</li>
  <li>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</li>
  <li>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</li>
  <li>With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>But there's a saying very old and true,</li>
  <li class="number">'If that you will France win,</li>
  <li>Then with Scotland first begin:'</li>
  <li>For once the eagle England being in prey,</li>
  <li>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot</li>
  <li>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,</li>
  <li class="number">Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</li>
  <li>To tear and havoc more than she can eat.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>It follows then the cat must stay at home:</li>
  <li>Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,</li>
  <li>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,</li>
  <li class="number">And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</li>
  <li>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</li>
  <li>The advised head defends itself at home;</li>
  <li>For government, though high and low and lower,</li>
  <li>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,</li>
  <li class="number">Congreeing in a full and natural close,</li>
  <li>Like music.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">CANTERBURY</li>
  <li>Therefore doth heaven divide</li>
  <li>The state of man in divers functions,</li>
  <li>Setting endeavour in continual motion;</li>
  <li class="number">To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,</li>
  <li>Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,</li>
  <li>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach</li>
  <li>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.</li>
  <li>They have a king and officers of sorts;</li>
  <li class="number">Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,</li>
  <li>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,</li>
  <li>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,</li>
  <li>Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,</li>
  <li>Which pillage they with merry march bring home</li>
  <li class="number">To the tent-royal of their emperor;</li>
  <li>Who, busied in his majesty, surveys</li>
  <li>The singing masons building roofs of gold,</li>
  <li>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,</li>
  <li>The poor mechanic porters crowding in</li>
  <li class="number">Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,</li>
  <li>The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,</li>
  <li>Delivering o'er to executors pale</li>
  <li>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,</li>
  <li>That many things, having full reference</li>
  <li class="number">To one consent, may work contrariously:</li>
  <li>As many arrows, loosed several ways,</li>
  <li>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;</li>
  <li>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;</li>
  <li>As many lines close in the dial's centre;</li>
  <li class="number">So may a thousand actions, once afoot.</li>
  <li>End in one purpose, and be all well borne</li>
  <li>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.</li>
  <li>Divide your happy England into four;</li>
  <li>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</li>

<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt some Attendants</li>
  <li>Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,</li>
  <li>And yours, the noble sinews of our power,</li>
  <li>France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,</li>
  <li>Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,</li>
  <li class="number">Ruling in large and ample empery</li>
  <li>O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,</li>
  <li>Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,</li>
  <li>Tombless, with no remembrance over them:</li>
  <li>Either our history shall with full mouth</li>
  <li class="number">Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,</li>
  <li>Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,</li>
  <li>Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter Ambassadors of France</li>
  <li>Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure</li>
  <li>Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear</li>
  <li class="number">Your greeting is from him, not from the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">First Ambassador</li>
  <li>May't please your majesty to give us leave</li>
  <li>Freely to render what we have in charge;</li>
  <li>Or shall we sparingly show you far off</li>
  <li>The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;</li>
  <li>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject</li>
  <li>As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:</li>
  <li>Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness</li>
  <li>Tell us the Dauphin's mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">First Ambassador</li>
  <li class="number">Thus, then, in few.</li>
  <li>Your highness, lately sending into France,</li>
  <li>Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right</li>
  <li>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.</li>
  <li>In answer of which claim, the prince our master</li>
  <li class="number">Says that you savour too much of your youth,</li>
  <li>And bids you be advised there's nought in France</li>
  <li>That can be with a nimble galliard won;</li>
  <li>You cannot revel into dukedoms there.</li>
  <li>He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,</li>
  <li class="number">This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,</li>
  <li>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</li>
  <li>Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>What treasure, uncle?</li>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>Tennis-balls, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;</li>
  <li>His present and your pains we thank you for:</li>
  <li>When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,</li>
  <li>We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set</li>
  <li>Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler</li>
  <li>That all the courts of France will be disturb'd</li>
  <li>With chaces. And we understand him well,</li>
  <li>How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,</li>
  <li>Not measuring what use we made of them.</li>
  <li class="number">We never valued this poor seat of England;</li>
  <li>And therefore, living hence, did give ourself</li>
  <li>To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common</li>
  <li>That men are merriest when they are from home.</li>
  <li>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</li>
  <li class="number">Be like a king and show my sail of greatness</li>
  <li>When I do rouse me in my throne of France:</li>
  <li>For that I have laid by my majesty</li>
  <li>And plodded like a man for working-days,</li>
  <li>But I will rise there with so full a glory</li>
  <li class="number">That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</li>
  <li>Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.</li>
  <li>And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his</li>
  <li>Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul</li>
  <li>Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance</li>
  <li class="number">That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows</li>
  <li>Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;</li>
  <li>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;</li>
  <li>And some are yet ungotten and unborn</li>
  <li>That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.</li>
  <li class="number">But this lies all within the will of God,</li>
  <li>To whom I do appeal; and in whose name</li>
  <li>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,</li>
  <li>To venge me as I may and to put forth</li>
  <li>My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.</li>
  <li class="number">So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin</li>
  <li>His jest will savour but of shallow wit,</li>
  <li>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.</li>
  <li>Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.</li>

  <li class="number">We hope to make the sender blush at it.</li>
  <li>Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH</div>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Well met, Corporal Nym.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">NYM</li>
  <li class="number">Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.</li>
</ol>

<li class="speaker">BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">NYM</li>
  <li>For my part, I care not: I say little; but when</li>
  <li>time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that</li>
  <li>shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will</li>
  <li class="number">wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but</li>
  <li>what though? it will toast cheese, and it will</li>
  <li>endure cold as another man's sword will: and</li>
  <li>there's an end.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and</li>
  <li class="number">we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it</li>
  <li>be so, good Corporal Nym.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">NYM</li>
  <li>Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the</li>
  <li>certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I</li>
  <li>will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the</li>
  <li class="number">rendezvous of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell</li>
  <li>Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you</li>
  <li>were troth-plight to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">NYM</li>
  <li>I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may</li>
  <li class="number">sleep, and they may have their throats about them at</li>
  <li>that time; and some say knives have edges. It must</li>
  <li>be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet</li>
  <li>she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I</li>
  <li>cannot tell.</li>

  <li>No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and</li>

  <li>I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an</li>

  <li class="number">foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my</li>
  <li>rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk</li>
  <li>off, I would prick your guts a little, in good</li>

  <li>By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:</li>
  <li>You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;</li>
  <li>For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,</li>
  <li class="number">As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.</li>
  <li>See you, my princes, and my noble peers,</li>
  <li>These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,</li>
  <li>You know how apt our love was to accord</li>
  <li>To furnish him with all appertinents</li>
  <li class="number">Belonging to his honour; and this man</li>
  <li>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,</li>
  <li>And sworn unto the practises of France,</li>
  <li>To kill us here in Hampton: to the which</li>
  <li>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</li>
  <li class="number">Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,</li>
  <li>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,</li>
  <li>Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!</li>
  <li>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</li>
  <li>That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,</li>
  <li class="number">That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,</li>
  <li>Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,</li>
  <li>May it be possible, that foreign hire</li>
  <li>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</li>
  <li>That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,</li>
  <li class="number">That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</li>
  <li>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</li>
  <li>Treason and murder ever kept together,</li>
  <li>As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,</li>
  <li>Working so grossly in a natural cause,</li>
  <li class="number">That admiration did not whoop at them:</li>
  <li>But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in</li>
  <li>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:</li>
  <li>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</li>
  <li>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</li>
  <li class="number">Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:</li>
  <li>All other devils that suggest by treasons</li>
  <li>Do botch and bungle up damnation</li>
  <li>With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd</li>
  <li>From glistering semblances of piety;</li>
  <li class="number">But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,</li>
  <li>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</li>
  <li>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</li>
  <li>If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus</li>
  <li>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</li>
  <li class="number">He might return to vasty Tartar back,</li>
  <li>And tell the legions 'I can never win</li>
  <li>A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'</li>
  <li>O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected</li>
  <li>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</li>
  <li class="number">Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?</li>
  <li>Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?</li>
  <li>Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?</li>
  <li>Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,</li>
  <li>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,</li>
  <li class="number">Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</li>
  <li>Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,</li>
  <li>Not working with the eye without the ear,</li>
  <li>And but in purged judgment trusting neither?</li>
  <li>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:</li>
  <li class="number">And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,</li>
  <li>To mark the full-fraught man and best indued</li>
  <li>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;</li>
  <li>For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like</li>
  <li>Another fall of man. Their faults are open:</li>

  <li>You have conspired against our royal person,</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded</li>
  <li>Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof</li>

  <li>We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  France. The KING'S palace.</h3>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</li>
  <li>Thus comes the English with full power upon us;</li>
  <li>And more than carefully it us concerns</li>
  <li>To answer royally in our defences.</li>
  <li>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,</li>
  <li class="number">Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,</li>
  <li>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,</li>
  <li>To line and new repair our towns of war</li>
  <li>With men of courage and with means defendant;</li>
  <li>For England his approaches makes as fierce</li>
  <li class="number">As waters to the sucking of a gulf.</li>
  <li>It fits us then to be as provident</li>
  <li>As fear may teach us out of late examples</li>
  <li>Left by the fatal and neglected English</li>
  <li>Upon our fields.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">DAUPHIN</li>
  <li class="number">My most redoubted father,</li>
  <li>It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;</li>
  <li>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,</li>
  <li>Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,</li>
  <li>But that defences, musters, preparations,</li>
  <li class="number">Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,</li>
  <li>As were a war in expectation.</li>
  <li>Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth</li>
  <li>To view the sick and feeble parts of France:</li>
  <li>And let us do it with no show of fear;</li>
  <li class="number">No, with no more than if we heard that England</li>

  <li>O peace, Prince Dauphin!</li>
  <li>You are too much mistaken in this king:</li>

  <li>With what great state he heard their embassy,</li>
  <li class="number">How well supplied with noble counsellors,</li>
  <li>How modest in exception, and withal</li>
  <li>How terrible in constant resolution,</li>
  <li>And you shall find his vanities forespent</li>

  <li>The enemy more mighty than he seems:</li>

  <li>Which of a weak or niggardly projection</li>

<li class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</li>
  <li>Think we King Harry strong;</li>

  <li>The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;</li>

  <li class="number">Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,</li>

  <li>Mangle the work of nature and deface</li>
  <li>The patterns that by God and by French fathers</li>

  <li>Willing to overlook this pedigree:</li>
  <li class="number">And when you find him evenly derived</li>

  <li>In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,</li>
  <li class="number">That, if requiring fail, he will compel;</li>
  <li>And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,</li>
  <li>Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy</li>
  <li>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war</li>
  <li>Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head</li>

  <li>The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,</li>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">Boy</li>
  <li class="number">As young as I am, I have observed these three</li>
  <li>swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they</li>
  <li>three, though they would serve me, could not be man</li>
  <li>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</li>
  <li>a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</li>
  <li class="number">red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</li>
  <li>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</li>
  <li>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</li>
  <li>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</li>
  <li>heard that men of few words are the best men; and</li>
  <li class="number">therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</li>
  <li>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</li>
  <li>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</li>
  <li>broke any man's head but his own, and that was</li>
  <li>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</li>
  <li class="number">any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</li>
  <li>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</li>
  <li>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</li>
  <li>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</li>
  <li>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</li>
  <li class="number">men would carry coals. They would have me as</li>
  <li>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</li>
  <li>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</li>
  <li>if I should take from another's pocket to put into</li>
  <li>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</li>
  <li class="number">must leave them, and seek some better service:</li>
  <li>their villany goes against my weak stomach, and</li>
  <li>therefore I must cast it up.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting</div>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">GOWER</li>
  <li>How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li class="number">I assure you, there is very excellent services</li>
  <li>committed at the bridge.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">GOWER</li>
  <li>Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li>The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;</li>
  <li>and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my</li>
  <li class="number">heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and</li>
  <li>my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and</li>
  <li>blessed! — any hurt in the world; but keeps the</li>
  <li>bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.</li>
  <li>There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the</li>
  <li class="number">pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as</li>
  <li>valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no</li>
  <li>estimation in the world; but did see him do as</li>
  <li>gallant service.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">GOWER</li>
  <li>What do you call him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li class="number">He is called Aunchient Pistol.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>I know him not.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PISTOL</div>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li>Here is the man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">PISTOL</li>
  <li>Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:</li>
  <li>The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at</li>

<li class="speaker">PISTOL</li>
  <li>Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,</li>
  <li>And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,</li>
  <li>And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,</li>
  <li class="number">That goddess blind,</li>
  <li>That stands upon the rolling restless stone — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li>By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is</li>
  <li>painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to</li>
  <li>signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is</li>
  <li class="number">painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which</li>
  <li>is the moral of it, that she is turning, and</li>
  <li>inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her</li>
  <li>foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,</li>
  <li>which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,</li>
  <li class="number">the poet makes a most excellent description of it:</li>
  <li>Fortune is an excellent moral.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">PISTOL</li>
  <li>Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;</li>
  <li>For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:</li>
  <li>A damned death!</li>
  <li class="number">Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free</li>
  <li>And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:</li>
  <li>But Exeter hath given the doom of death</li>
  <li>For pax of little price.</li>
  <li>Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:</li>
  <li class="number">And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut</li>
  <li>With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:</li>
  <li>Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li>Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">PISTOL</li>
  <li>Why then, rejoice therefore.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">FLUELLEN</li>
  <li class="number">Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice</li>
  <li>at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would</li>
  <li>desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put</li>
  <li>him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">PISTOL</li>
  <li>Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!</li>

  <li>Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then</li>

  <li>done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,</li>
  <li class="number">at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was</li>
  <li>shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;</li>
  <li>and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,</li>
  <li>which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what</li>
  <li>a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of</li>
  <li class="number">the camp will do among foaming bottles and</li>
  <li>ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But</li>

  <li>Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has</li>

  <li>Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:</li>
  <li>Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage</li>
  <li>is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we</li>
  <li>could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we</li>
  <li class="number">thought not good to bruise an injury till it were</li>
  <li>full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice</li>
  <li>is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see</li>
  <li>his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him</li>
  <li>therefore consider of his ransom; which must</li>
  <li class="number">proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we</li>
  <li>have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in</li>
  <li>weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.</li>
  <li>For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the</li>
  <li>effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too</li>
  <li class="number">faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own</li>
  <li>person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and</li>
  <li>worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and</li>
  <li>tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his</li>
  <li>followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far</li>

  <li>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</li>
  <li class="number">My numbers lessened, and those few I have</li>
  <li>Almost no better than so many French;</li>
  <li>Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,</li>
  <li>I thought upon one pair of English legs</li>
  <li>Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,</li>

  <li>Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;</li>
  <li>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,</li>
  <li>My army but a weak and sickly guard;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,</li>

  <li>If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,</li>

<li class="speaker">ORLEANS</li>
  <li>You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">DAUPHIN</li>
  <li>What a long night is this! I will not change my</li>
  <li class="number">horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.</li>
  <li>Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his</li>
  <li>entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,</li>
  <li>chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I</li>
  <li>soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth</li>
  <li class="number">sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his</li>
  <li>hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">ORLEANS</li>
  <li>He's of the colour of the nutmeg.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">DAUPHIN</li>
  <li>And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for</li>
  <li>Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull</li>
  <li class="number">elements of earth and water never appear in him, but</li>
  <li>only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts</li>
  <li>him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you</li>
  <li>may call beasts.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">DAUPHIN</li>
  <li class="number">It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the</li>

  <li>No more, cousin.</li>

<li class="speaker">DAUPHIN</li>
  <li>Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the</li>

  <li class="number">deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as</li>
  <li>fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent</li>
  <li>tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:</li>
  <li>'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for</li>
  <li>a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the</li>
  <li class="number">world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart</li>
  <li>their particular functions and wonder at him. I</li>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I</li>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be</li>
  <li>washed off the next tide.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BATES</li>
  <li>He hath not told his thought to the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I</li>
  <li>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I</li>
  <li class="number">am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the</li>
  <li>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his</li>
  <li>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies</li>
  <li>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and</li>
  <li>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,</li>
  <li class="number">yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like</li>
  <li>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</li>
  <li>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</li>
  <li>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</li>
  <li>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</li>
  <li class="number">it, should dishearten his army.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BATES</li>
  <li>He may show what outward courage he will; but I</li>
  <li>believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</li>
  <li>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he</li>
  <li>were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</li>
  <li>I think he would not wish himself any where but</li>
  <li>where he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BATES</li>
  <li>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be</li>
  <li>sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</li>
  <li>alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</li>
  <li>minds: methinks I could not die any where so</li>
  <li>contented as in the king's company; his cause being</li>
  <li>just and his quarrel honourable.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">WILLIAMS</li>
  <li class="number">That's more than we know.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BATES</li>
  <li>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know</li>
  <li>enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if</li>
  <li>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</li>
  <li>the crime of it out of us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">WILLIAMS</li>
  <li class="number">But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</li>
  <li>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</li>
  <li>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</li>
  <li>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</li>
  <li>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a</li>
  <li class="number">surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</li>
  <li>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</li>
  <li>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</li>
  <li>well that die in a battle; for how can they</li>
  <li>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</li>
  <li class="number">argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</li>
  <li>will be a black matter for the king that led them to</li>
  <li>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of</li>
  <li>subjection.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>So, if a son that is by his father sent about</li>
  <li class="number">merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</li>
  <li>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</li>
  <li>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</li>
  <li>servant, under his master's command transporting a</li>
  <li>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</li>
  <li class="number">many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</li>
  <li>business of the master the author of the servant's</li>
  <li>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</li>
  <li>bound to answer the particular endings of his</li>
  <li>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</li>
  <li class="number">his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</li>
  <li>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</li>
  <li>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</li>
  <li>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</li>
  <li>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</li>
  <li class="number">the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</li>
  <li>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</li>
  <li>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</li>
  <li>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</li>
  <li>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</li>
  <li class="number">defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</li>
  <li>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</li>
  <li>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</li>
  <li>so that here men are punished for before-breach of</li>
  <li>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</li>
  <li class="number">they feared the death, they have borne life away;</li>
  <li>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</li>
  <li>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</li>
  <li>their damnation than he was before guilty of those</li>
  <li>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</li>
  <li class="number">subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</li>
  <li>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</li>
  <li>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</li>
  <li>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</li>
  <li>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was</li>
  <li class="number">blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</li>
  <li>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</li>
  <li>that, making God so free an offer, He let him</li>
  <li>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</li>
  <li>others how they should prepare.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">WILLIAMS</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon</li>
  <li>his own head, the king is not to answer it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of</li>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,</li>
  <li class="number">Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am</li>
  <li>glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if</li>
  <li>thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king</li>
  <li>that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my</li>
  <li>crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but</li>
  <li class="number">directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me</li>
  <li>farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out</li>
  <li>my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so</li>
  <li>clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li>Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for</li>
  <li>your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I</li>
  <li>have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I</li>
  <li>have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</li>
  <li>measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</li>
  <li class="number">leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</li>
  <li>armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</li>
  <li>be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</li>
  <li>Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</li>
  <li>for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and</li>
  <li class="number">sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,</li>
  <li>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my</li>
  <li>eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;</li>
  <li>only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</li>
  <li>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</li>
  <li class="number">fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth</li>
  <li>sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love</li>
  <li>of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy</li>
  <li>cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst</li>
  <li>love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee</li>
  <li class="number">that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the</li>
  <li>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou</li>
  <li>livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and</li>
  <li>uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee</li>
  <li>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</li>
  <li class="number">places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</li>
  <li>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</li>
  <li>always reason themselves out again. What! a</li>
  <li>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</li>
  <li>good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a</li>
  <li class="number">black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow</li>
  <li>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax</li>
  <li>hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</li>
  <li>moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it</li>
  <li>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</li>
  <li class="number">course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</li>
  <li>me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,</li>
  <li>take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</li>
  <li>speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li>Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li class="number">No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of</li>
  <li>France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love</li>
  <li>the friend of France; for I love France so well that</li>
  <li>I will not part with a village of it; I will have it</li>
  <li>all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am</li>
  <li class="number">yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li>I cannot tell vat is dat.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am</li>
  <li>sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married</li>
  <li>wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook</li>
  <li class="number">off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand</li>
  <li>vous avez le possession de moi —  let me see, what</li>
  <li>then? Saint Denis be my speed! — donc votre est</li>
  <li>France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,</li>
  <li>Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much</li>
  <li class="number">more French: I shall never move thee in French,</li>
  <li>unless it be to laugh at me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li>Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il</li>
  <li>est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my</li>
  <li class="number">tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs</li>
  <li>be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou</li>
  <li>understand thus much English, canst thou love me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li>I cannot tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask</li>
  <li class="number">them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,</li>
  <li>when you come into your closet, you'll question this</li>
  <li>gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to</li>
  <li>her dispraise those parts in me that you love with</li>
  <li>your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the</li>
  <li class="number">rather, gentle princess, because I love thee</li>
  <li>cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a</li>
  <li>saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get</li>
  <li>thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs</li>
  <li>prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,</li>
  <li class="number">between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a</li>
  <li>boy, half French, half English, that shall go to</li>
  <li>Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?</li>
  <li>shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair</li>
  <li>flower-de-luce?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li class="number">I do not know dat</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do</li>
  <li>but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your</li>
  <li>French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety</li>
  <li>take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer</li>
  <li class="number">you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher</li>
  <li>et devin deesse?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KATHARINE</li>
  <li>Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">KING HENRY V</li>
  <li>Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in</li>
  <li class="number">true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I</li>
  <li>dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to</li>
  <li>flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor</li>
  <li>and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew</li>
  <li>my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars</li>
  <li class="number">when he got me: therefore was I created with a</li>
  <li>stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when</li>
  <li>I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,</li>
  <li>Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:</li>
  <li>my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of</li>
  <li class="number">beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou</li>
  <li>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou</li>
  <li>shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:</li>
  <li>and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you</li>
  <li>have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the</li>
  <li class="number">thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;</li>
  <li>take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am</li>
  <li>thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine</li>
  <li>ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is</li>
  <li>thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry</li>
  <li class="number">Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before</li>
  <li>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,</li>
  <li>thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.</li>
  <li>Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is</li>
  <li>music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of</li>
  <li class="number">all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken</li>
  <li>English; wilt thou have me?</li>

  <li>O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear</li>
  <li>Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak</li>
  <li class="number">list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of</li>
  <li>manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our</li>
  <li>places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will</li>
  <li>do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your</li>
  <li>country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently</li>
  <li class="number">and yielding.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kissing her</li>
  <li>You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is</li>
  <li>more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the</li>

  <li>sooner persuade Harry of England than a general</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
<li class="speaker">BURGUNDY</li>
  <li>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you</li>
  <li>for that. If you would conjure in her, you must</li>

  <li>I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will</li>
